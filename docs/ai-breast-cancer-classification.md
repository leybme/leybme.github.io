# Design a Breast Cancer Classification using AI base on polarimetry images of cancer cells

## Skills

Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation, Model Deployment

## Description

The project aims to design and develop an AI-based breast cancer classification system using polarimetry images of cancer cells. The system will be trained on a dataset of polarimetry images to classify cancer cells as benign or malignant based on their features. The AI model will use machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the images and make predictions with high accuracy.
