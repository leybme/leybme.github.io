## Skills

C++, Microcontroller, Sensor, Data Acquisition, Data Processing, User Interface, Cost Analysis, Compliance, Design for Manufacturing

## Project Overview

The project aims to design and develop a state-of-the-art uroflowmeter, a medical device used to measure the flow rate of urine over time. This device is critical for diagnosing and monitoring patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and other urological disorders. The uroflowmeter will be designed to be user-friendly, accurate, and cost-effective, providing both patients and healthcare providers with reliable and easy-to-interpret dat

## Key technologies

1. **ESP32-S3 N16R2 Microcontroller:**
   - Provides powerful processing capabilities and built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity for data transfer.
   - Ideal for real-time data processing and interfacing with external sensors.
   - Offers a cost-effective solution for integrating advanced features into the uroflowmeter.
   - **Language: C++**

2. **Hardware:**
   - Designed to house the microcontroller and other electronic components efficiently.
   - Ensures a compact and reliable design for the uroflowmeter.
   - Used USB Hub IC for interfacing with the microcontroller add more capabilities to expand the device. 
   - **Software: EasyEDA Pro**

3. **Cover:**
   - The cover is printed by PETG material, durable with humidity and UV resistance.
   - The top cover is design by acrylic material with UV print to make the device more aesthetic.
   - The design of product is design for easy to assemble and disassemble for maintenance.
   - It have ability to water resistance and easy to clean.
   - The funnel for urine is design to link with the device by a magnetic connector, easy to clean and one-hand use.
   - **Software: Fusion 360**

4. **Firmware and Software:**
   - The device record the urine data of patient and save to flash memory. data can transfer to PC via USB port or upload to Firebase Realtime Database.
   - The device is can easy use, work with only 2 button, one for power and one for wake up the device.
   - The device can OTA update without need to connect to PC, just connect to Wi-Fi.
   - Software on PC can view both data from device and Firebase Realtime Database. Display the time, volume, flow rate, and graph of flow rate. It also display the data in history chart.
   - **Technology: C++, C##, Firebase RTDB**
