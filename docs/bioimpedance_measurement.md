# Bioimpedance Measurement

## Skills
STM32H7, ESP32, C++, Bioimpedance, Impedance Measurement, Signal Processing, Data Analysis, User Interface, Safety Features, Compliance, FreeRTOS

## Description
In this project, I designed and developed several bioimpedance measurement systems for applications such as human body impedance analysis, electrical impedance tomography, and epithelial electrical resistance. The work spanned multiple prototypes based on STM32H7 and ESP32 microcontrollers. One design combined an ESP32-S3 with an Analog Devices AD5941 analog front-end, for which I wrote embedded C++ firmware and signal processing routines. Another implementation used an STM32H7 paired with a third-party high-performance AFE, integrating FreeRTOS and a custom discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm for real-time impedance computation. Through this project, I deepened my expertise in embedded systems programming, real-time operating systems, and advanced signal processing techniques.
