## Introduction
This Vue app is designed to display the abstract book of the conference, with data imported from a live Google Sheet link via a public function. The app uses Axios to fetch the CSV file and display it. The main features of the app include displaying abstracts, and searching abstracts by keywords and submission ID.

This project is a showcase of my journey learning Vue.js. I completed it in 5 days, demonstrating my ability to quickly grasp and apply new technologies.
