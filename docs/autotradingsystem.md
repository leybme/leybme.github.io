## Description

I successfully designed and developed an automatic trading system capable of trading on financial markets without human intervention. The system is built around my proprietary algorithm, which I researched and tested extensively over the years. By using PineScript on TradingView, I was able to facilitate easy backtesting and tuning of the algorithm.

To enable trade execution, I created a bridge linking TradingView to the MetaTrader 4/5 platform. This bridge utilized Google Cloud Functions and TradingView's Webhook notifications to save trade requests to Firebase Realtime Database. MetaTrader 4/5 then read these trade requests from Firebase RTDB and executed the trades accordingly.

A significant feature of the system is its risk management component, which effectively controls trading risks and prevents overtrading. This project stands as a testament to my ability to integrate various technologies to create a seamless and automated trading solution.

It's important to note that the algorithm is not public or for sale. This project underscores my capabilities in integrating various technologies to create a seamless and automated trading solution.
